  |   This is the PROPER of DarKmooN's release, which is only the DEMO      |
  |   version! The wrong Title ID: 0100CA300C5BA000 and only 216mb.         |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The Game was only just released now, and we present you the full      |
  |   version, as usual - on time!                                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   What a surprise to find out that a known public/p2p titlekey          |
  |   database contains this very same game/titleid since 12th November.    |
  |   Without mentioning DEMO version either, what a coincidence?           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   This makes all their recent eShop releases look highly suspicious.    |
  |   These games also are not new releases - and their titlekey has been   |
  |   shared already on release date.                                       |
  |   Stop stealing titlekeys from the public and claiming them as your     |
  |   own releases like BBB.                                                |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Also any method to dump these games would always clearly show you     |
  |   the game is a DEMO before downloading, or atleast when installing     |
  |   and actually testing the game. This behaviour speaks for itself.      |
